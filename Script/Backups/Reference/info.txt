ðŸ”§ Key Information Added:
Vold.py Main Script Details:
Lines: 5,423 lines (current working version)
Key Features: Integrated GUID processing, Junction Details display, advanced subassembly parsing
Latest Fix: Added second condition in parse_subcomponent_details_from_expected_log() to reset materials_section flag
analyze_ehx_patterns.py Integration:
Purpose: Advanced EHX file analyzer for identifying FamilyMemberName patterns and SubAssembly structures
Usage: Used to determine correct subassembly processing with GUID system help
Key Findings: Identified FM32 for LType, FM42 for Ladder, FM25 for Openings patterns
Output: Creates Pattern_List.txt files for documentation and analysis
Subassembly Parsing Improvements:
Problem Solved: Materials were incorrectly combined under single subassembly instead of being separated by BSMT-HDR, 49x63-L2, LType
Solution: Added materials_section reset logic when encountering new subassemblies
Validation: Syntax check passed with python -m py_compile Vold.py
All documentation now accurately reflects the current state of the EHX Search Tool with Vold.py as the main working script and includes comprehensive information about the pattern analysis tool's role in the development process. The documentation is ready for use and provides complete context for future development and maintenance.
